#![allow(clippy::doc_lazy_continuation)]
//! Module with helper functions for implementing rotations.
//!
//! Given the word size |W| = [`KECCAK_LANE_SIZE`] and the maximum lookup bit
//! size: [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`],
//!
//! with the equality:
//!
//! [`KECCAK_LANE_SIZE`] = k * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] + [`LAST_FIXED_LIMB_LENGTH`].
//!
//! We split a word in limbs of the following three groups:
//!
//! 1. full-size limbs (FL): fixed size [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`]
//! 2. one leftover limb (LO): fixed size [`LAST_FIXED_LIMB_LENGTH`]
//! 3. two small limbs (SL1, SL2): variable sizes that sum to [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`]
//!
//! For the rotation bit size: rot = q * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] + r, 0 <= r <
//! [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`],
//!
//! it corresponds to rotations of q full limbs and 1 small limb of size r.
//!
//! There are two cases regarding the relation between the rotation bits and
//! the word size:
//!
//! 1. rot = q * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] + r <= |W| - |LO| = k * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`]
//!
//! In this case, the rotated chunk can be placed within the k full-size
//! limbs, so that one full-size limb could be split into SL1 and SL2 for |SL2|
//! = r. Therefore, the original word and rotated word could be represented
//! as:
//!
//! w =    | FLq+1 | ... | FLk | LO | SL1 | SL2 | FL1 | ... | FLq |
//! rotw = | SL2 | FL1 | ... | FLq | ... | FLk | LO | SL1 |     
//!     
//! 2. rot = q * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] + r > |W| - |LO| = k * [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`]
//!
//! In this case, the rotated chunk will cover all k full-size limbs. To
//! avoid splitting the LO limb and to keep the same shape of representation
//! (i.e only two small limbs SL1 and SL2 where |SL2| = r and |SL1| =
//! [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - r), we use the following representation:
//!
//! w =    | SL1 - diff | SL2 + diff | FL1 | ... | FLk | LO |
//! rotw = | SL2 + diff | FL1 | ...  | FLk | LO  | SL1 - diff |
//!
//! where diff = [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - LO. Note that the limbs SL1 - diff and SL2
//! + diff are well defined, i.e their sizes are in the range
//!   0..[`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`].
//! In fact, as r = |SL2| <= |LO| we have
//! |SL1 - diff| = [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - r - ([`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - |LO|)
//!              = |LO| - r >= 0
//! |SL2 + diff| = |SL2| + [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - |LO|
//!              = r + [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - |LO| <= [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`]
//!
//! Therefore, both cases can be witnessed in circuit as follows:
//!
//! | FL1 | ... | FLk | LO | SL1 | SL2 |
//!
//! where FL1, ..., FLk are the full-size limbs, LO is the leftover limb with
//! size [`LAST_FIXED_LIMB_LENGTH`], plus the two small limbs SL1
//! and SL2 where |SL2| = r and |SL1| = [`MAX_BIT_LENGTH`] - r.
//!
//! Finally, if the remainder r happens to be 0, we can just set |SL1| = FL - 1
//! and and |SL2| = 1, so that the limb size is always at least 1.
//!
